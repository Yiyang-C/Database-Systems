Q1:
Linear equation:
	-0.1084 * CRIM + 
	0.0458 * ZN + 
	2.7187 * CHAS + 
	-17.376 * NOX + 
	3.8016 * RM + 
	-1.4927 * DIS + 
	0.2996 * RAD + 
	-0.0118 * TAX + 
	-0.9465 * PTRATIO + 
	0.0093 * B + 
	-0.5226 * LSTAT +
	36.3411

There are 12 terms in the equation (Including a constant term).
The reason why the equation has 12 terms instead of 14 terms is that
the above 12 terms give the most accurate linear regression model under a certain criterion (like AUC of ROC).
Or we can say, there is no significant relationship between the proportion of non-retail business acres per town and MEDV. 
Additionally, there is no significant relationship between the proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940 and MEDV as well.
